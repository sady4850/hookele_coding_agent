# Write Compressor

## Overview

This skill provides strategies for implementing encoders that produce output compatible with existing decoders. It applies to tasks involving compression algorithms, arithmetic coding, entropy encoding, or any scenario requiring the construction of an encoder as the mathematical inverse of a decoder.

## Core Principle: Encoder as Decoder Inverse

When implementing an encoder for an existing decoder, the encoder must be the exact mathematical inverse of the decoder operations. Every decoder operation has a corresponding encoder operation that must produce the exact values the decoder expects to read.

### Mathematical Derivation First

Before writing any code:

1. **Document the decoder's state machine** - Identify all state variables (e.g., `low`, `high`, `range`, `fraction`) and how they evolve
2. **Derive encoder operations algebraically** - For each decoder read operation, derive what the encoder must write
3. **Verify the inverse relationship on paper** - Prove mathematically that encoder output → decoder input produces the original data

## Recommended Approach

### Phase 1: Understand the Decoder Completely

1. Read the entire decoder implementation thoroughly
2. Trace through the decoder manually with simple inputs
3. Document every state variable and its valid ranges
4. Identify the bit/byte reading patterns and what values they produce
5. Map out conditional branches and what triggers each path

### Phase 2: Start with Minimal Cases

Build the encoder incrementally, verifying each step:

1. **Zero operations** - Encode an empty/minimal input and verify it decodes correctly
2. **Single simple operation** - Encode one basic element (e.g., one literal character)
3. **Two operations** - Verify state carries correctly between operations
4. **Gradually increase complexity** - Only after simpler cases work

### Phase 3: Side-by-Side State Verification

Create a verification harness that:

1. Runs encoder and decoder in parallel (or simulates this)
2. Compares state variables after every single operation
3. Immediately identifies the first point of divergence
4. Prints both encoder and decoder state at each step for debugging

### Phase 4: Full Implementation

Only after phases 1-3 succeed, proceed to full file encoding.

## Verification Strategies

### Unit Testing Individual Components

For arithmetic coding or similar algorithms, test each component independently:

- Bit encoding/decoding in isolation
- Integer encoding/decoding in isolation
- Symbol encoding/decoding in isolation
- Back-reference or special token encoding in isolation

### Round-Trip Testing

```
original_data → encoder → compressed → decoder → recovered_data
assert original_data == recovered_data
```

Run round-trip tests at each complexity level before proceeding.

### State Trace Comparison

Build a debugging mode that outputs encoder state at each step. Feed the compressed output to the decoder with similar tracing. Compare traces to find divergence.

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Renormalization Formula Errors

In arithmetic coding, the renormalization step is critical. The formula for outputting bytes during renormalization must exactly match how the decoder reconstructs the fraction from bytes.

**Prevention**: Trace through specific numeric examples by hand. If the decoder reads bytes as `fraction += read_byte() - 1`, derive exactly what the encoder must output.

### 2. Off-by-One Errors

Common in:
- Range calculations
- Byte output values (e.g., `+1`, `-1`, `% 256` adjustments)
- Loop bounds for flush/finalization

**Prevention**: Use concrete numeric examples with known expected outputs.

### 3. Flushing/Finalization Errors

The final bytes to flush the encoder state are often implemented incorrectly.

**Prevention**: Test the flush procedure separately with known encoder states.

### 4. Premature Optimization

Worrying about output size before achieving correctness.

**Prevention**: First make it work, then make it small. A working 3KB output is infinitely better than a broken 2KB output.

### 5. Trial-and-Error Implementation

Making random changes to formulas hoping something works.

**Prevention**: Every change should be justified by mathematical reasoning about why the previous version was wrong and why the new version is correct.

### 6. Parallel Implementation Attempts

Creating multiple encoder files (`encoder.py`, `encoder2.py`, `encoder_v3.py`) spreads effort thin.

**Prevention**: Work on one implementation. Use version control to track changes. Debug deeply rather than rewriting from scratch.

## Debugging Strategy

When the decoder crashes or produces wrong output:

1. **Identify the first failure point** - Where exactly does decoding first go wrong?
2. **Compare states at that point** - What did the encoder think the state was vs. what the decoder computed?
3. **Trace backward** - Find the operation that caused the divergence
4. **Fix with mathematical justification** - Don't just try random changes

### For Segmentation Faults in Decoder

A segfault typically means:
- Invalid memory access from corrupted indices
- The compressed stream is structurally invalid
- The encoder produced bytes the decoder interprets as impossible values

Debug by:
1. Adding bounds checking to the decoder (temporarily)
2. Printing decoder state before the crash
3. Identifying what impossible state was reached
4. Tracing back to what encoder output caused this

## Decision Checklist

Before claiming the encoder is complete:

- [ ] Does the simplest possible input (empty/zero) encode and decode correctly?
- [ ] Does a single-element input encode and decode correctly?
- [ ] Have edge cases been tested (empty strings, maximum values, boundary conditions)?
- [ ] Has a side-by-side state trace been performed for at least one non-trivial input?
- [ ] Does the full input encode and decode correctly?
- [ ] If there are size constraints, does the output meet them?
